# Concurrency with Go Backend

## Create the Go Server

Set up a Go server that listens for WebSocket connections from clients.
Use Goroutines to handle multiple clients simultaneously. Each connection will be managed as a separate Goroutine.
Implement concurrency control with channels or other synchronization mechanisms to avoid race conditions while multiple users are editing the document at the same time.

## Handle Concurrent Edits

Store the document state in memory or in a database.
Implement locking mechanisms (e.g., mutexes) or optimistic concurrency control to prevent issues like overwriting changes when multiple users edit the same document section simultaneously.
Broadcast changes back to all clients using WebSockets once an edit is confirmed.
